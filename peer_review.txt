Your first part looks good. However, you can include subsection number for clear navigation. I think you did Part2 1st question right, but I do not see answers to the other 2 questions. Since the part 3 is incomplete in your report, I don't have any comment for it. Overall, great job Chelsey. Make sure you don't predict seizure seizure seizure seizure in part 3.
